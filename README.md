## Overview
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to classify a dataset with multiple features. Various feature selection techniques and classification algorithms were employed to achieve robust performance. The project includes a detailed evaluation of four primary models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with metrics like Accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC AUC used to assess performance. Additional tests were conducted to verify model generalization using a large, unseen dataset.
